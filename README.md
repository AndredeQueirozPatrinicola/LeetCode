# LeetCode
Some leetcode solutions

###### Comments:
###### Some exercises may not work property yet because of the LeetCode's "NodeList" system. When you declare a list "l1 = [1,2,3]" they're system reads it like a Nodelist not a regular list and because of that, some list methods like "reverse()" do not work. Currently working on the conversion.
